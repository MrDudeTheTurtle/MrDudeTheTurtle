<h2 style="position: 50%">Hello, I'm MrDudeTheTurtle - A beginning coder/programmer, and I do random crap.</h2>

I am somewhat decent at programming, and am learning somewhat quickly.
All I really have learned so far is basic JavaScript, HTML and CSS, as most do, but have also started trying to learn C#.
